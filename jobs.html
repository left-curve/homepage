(Please don't send DMs on Twitter, Telegram, Discord, etc. Too many spams; I don't often check them.)

        The two most valuable things I look for are 1) <b>previous experience with web3/web2 projects</b>, and 2) <b>testimonials from coworders, managers, or clients</b>. Definitely indicate if you have them.

          You will lead the development of an innovative "portal" webapp, which we believe will drastically change the way users interact with blockchains. This portal will have two characteristics:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-1">
          <li class="mb-1">
            <b>A "super app" experience.</b> Instead of navigating many different domains and websites, users will access all apps on our chain through a single portal app. Apps are abstracted as "applets" which are loaded into the DOM upon user request. We will create a design guideline and an SDK to faciliate development of applets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Key-less wallet.</b> Instead of figuring out seed phrases and browser extensions, users will generate and store <a href="https://passkey.org/">Passkeys</a> in their device or clour keychains, and sign transactions using fingerprint or Face ID.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-1">
          We want to make the app available both in broswer as well as iOS and Android apps, so familiarity with technologies such as React Native is preferred.

          You will be involved in developing <a href="grug.html">Grug</a>, a new execution environment for blockchains. You need to be fluent in the Rust language. Additionally, we seek developers specifically with the following skills:
        </p>
        <ul class="mb-1">
          <li class="mb-1">
            <b>async and multi-thread programming in Rust</b>

          Experience with blockchain core engineering is nice to have but not required. Don't be discouraged if you don't have such experience! Veteran core devs are so few and rare. We can learn from scratch together.
